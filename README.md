# Customer Segmentation using DBSCAN
This project is a Python-based GUI application that performs customer segmentation on mall datasets using Scikit-learn's DBSCAN algorithm. Featuring a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5, it enables easy CSV file selection, column-wise clustering, and visualizes the results through real-time plots and dynamic tablesâ€”highlighting both cluster groups and outliers for clear and interactive analysis
A Python-based GUI application for mall customer segmentation using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Built with PyQt5, it allows interactive CSV file selection, column-wise clustering, real-time visualization, and saving of results.

## Features
- Upload CSV files via GUI
- Select specific columns for clustering
- Visualize clusters and outliers using Matplotlib
- Display data in an interactive table
- Save the clustered data with labels to CSV
